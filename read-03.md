True or false (scroll for answers)

Browsers indent lists by default.

If the blur distance value of the box-shadow property is ommitted, the shadow is a solid line like a border.

The border property allows you to specify the width, style, and color of a border in one property.

The visibility property allows you to hide boxes from users but it leaves a space where the element would have been.

A variable with no value assigned to it is falsey.
