When you move any element from normal flow, boxes can overlap. The z-index property allows you to control which box appears on top.

Relative positioning does not effect the positions of surrounding elements.

The liquid layout uses percentages to specify the width of each box so that the design will stretch to fit the size of the screen.

If a containing element only contains floated elements, some browsers will treat it as if it is zero pixels tall.

Designers keep pages within 800-900 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 500 pixels.
